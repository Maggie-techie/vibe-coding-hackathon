# prompts i used for this project
 # Prompt for claude ai
Hi .... today clinics and private doctors lose track of patients follow ups therefore i want a tool that automatically reminds both doctors and patients of appointments via SMS, WhatsApp, or other channels. Key Features to Build
* Doctor Login / Dashboard ‚Üí Add, view, and manage patient records.
* Patient Details Capture ‚Üí Name, phone number, appointment date, follow-up schedule.
* Automated Reminder Engine ‚Üí Set AI-powered scheduling (i want you to suggest optimal follow-up time based on appointment type). ‚Üí Send reminders via SMS/WhatsApp (using APIs like Twilio or Africa‚Äôs Talking).
* View Reminders History ‚Üí Doctors can view sent and upcoming reminders.
* Error Handling & Data Security ‚Üí Proper validations and secure patient data management.
* AI-prompted health tips with the follow-up message ‚ÄúHey John! Remember your follow-up appointment tomorrow at 10 AM. Quick tip: Stay hydrated and avoid heavy meals before your check-up!‚Äù
* Audio notification / vibing animation when reminder is sent successfully.
i want you to to help manage patient follow-up reminders by doing the following tasks:
Given the following patient appointment information:
- Patient Name: [PATIENT_NAME]
- Phone Number: [PHONE_NUMBER]
- Appointment Date: [APPOINTMENT_DATE] (format: YYYY-MM-DD)
- Appointment Type: [APPOINTMENT_TYPE]
Do the following:
1. Check if any required fields are missing. Required fields are: Patient Name, Phone Number, Appointment Date, and Appointment Type. If any are missing, list them under "Missing Fields". If all are present, say "All good".
2. Generate a Follow-Up Date based on the Appointment Type:
- General check-up ‚Üí 14 days later
- Lab test result review ‚Üí 7 days later
- Dental check-up ‚Üí 30 days later
- Vaccination ‚Üí 21 days later
- Other ‚Üí 10 days later
Use the Appointment Date to calculate the Follow-Up Date.
3. Write a polite SMS reminder to the patient for their follow-up appointment. Keep it under 160 characters and friendly.
4. Generate a motivational health tip under 100 characters that can be sent as part of the SMS.
5. Format the response i an appealing way.
* I want you to design the best possible UI/UX for this tool, following modern, clean, minimalistic design principles with a human-centered, joy-driven aesthetic. The design should evoke trust, calmness, and simplicity while being highly functional.
Here‚Äôs what I want you to include:
   1. A beautiful landing screen/dashboard with calming colors (soft blues, light greens, whites, and hints of warm neutrals), rounded corners, soft shadows, and light, clean typography (recommend fonts too).
   2. Smart, well-styled buttons: Use modern button styles with good padding, rounded edges (10‚Äì16px), subtle shadows, and hover/tap effects. Colors should contrast well against the background while maintaining a soft, professional look.
   3. Smooth animations: Recommend subtle UI animations for button clicks, screen transitions, notification popups, and loaders ‚Äî no overdone effects. Think Material Design motion or Apple Human Interface Guidelines.
   4. Joyful microinteractions: Include delightful details like animated checkmarks after sending a reminder, or gentle health tip cards that fade in smoothly.
   5. A responsive layout: Mobile-first, with easy adaptability to desktop. Recommend layouts, spacing, and grid systems.
   6. Typography hierarchy: Suggest font sizes, weights, and how to structure headings, subheadings, and body text for maximum readability.
   7. Use of icons and illustrations: Recommend modern icon packs or AI-generated illustrations for medical and wellness visuals.
   8. Color palette: Propose 3‚Äì4 color schemes optimized for healthcare/wellness apps with color codes.
   9. Best design practices: Suggest UI/UX patterns used by leading health apps (like Headspace, Calm, or Ada Health) that I should borrow for better user flow and engagement.
   10. Code styling guide (optional): If possible, provide CSS/Tailwind styling rules for buttons, cards, input fields, and animations.
this is all how i want the tool to look like  generate for me a good powerful prompt that will ensure i get the best outcome.
